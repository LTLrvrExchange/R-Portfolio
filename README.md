# R-Portfolio - These programs are mean't to assist in overcoming the R learning curve. Each program consists of several analyses and forms a complete product. These programs were compiled and modified from books, workshops, college classes, online courses, and online help groups. No programs were copyrighted and all current and future programs are freely available to the public. These programs were funded as part of the EPA's 2018 National Environmental Information Exchange Grant to build the analytical capacity of Redwood Valley Rancheria.  We make no claims to the functionality of the code, although we did our best to develop them. Users are invited to provide feedback.
